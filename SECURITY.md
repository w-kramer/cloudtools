# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue :mega:

I take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or any issues that could compromise the security of our platform, I appreciate your responsible disclosure. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

### How to Report

- **GitHub Security**: you can [report a vulnerability](https://github.com/w-kramer/cloudtools/security)

> Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues as this is a security risk itself, as it could allow malicious users to exploit the vulnerability before it is fixed.

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please provide the following information:

- A detailed description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any additional information that could help us understand and address the problem.

### What We Promise

- We will acknowledge your report promptly.
- We will investigate and validate the issue.
- We will keep you informed of our progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

CloudIPs encourages responsible disclosure to ensure the prompt resolution of security issues. We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Measures

We are committed to maintaining a secure platform. Here are some of the security measures we have in place:

- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted to and from cloudtools.cult-x.io is encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
- **Access Controls**: We implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to our systems.

Your cooperation in responsibly disclosing security issues is crucial in ensuring the security of our platform. Thank you for your commitment to a safer online community.

## Preferred Communication Language

I prefer communication in English :gb: / :us: or German :de: to ensure effective and clear collaboration in addressing security concerns.
